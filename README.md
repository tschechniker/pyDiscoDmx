# pyDiscoDmx

pyDiscoDmx is a simple sound to light DMX controller. It interprets the Audio input of your default System input device ( which can be a line in or a mic ) and triggers chases based on it.

Currently only a uDMX usb controller is supported. But as of this is kind of the cheapest one this should not be a large limitation.
